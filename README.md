# Work Day Scheduler
An easy work day scheduler that helps plan different events out. It offers color options to allow you to keep track of the time of different activities. The top has a live clock feature, so you're able to keep up as well. The past is signified by a graying of the past hour blocks, the present is indicated by red, and the green is yet to come.

This will also allow the user to save their activity data to the browser, so they can return to the schedule without fail.
